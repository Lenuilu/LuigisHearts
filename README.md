# Luigi's Hearts
Balatro concept texture pack for a (eventual) full retexture of Balatro featuring assets from Luigi's Picture Poker and some new assets with Luigi Poker theming
Consider this a demo that only includes the hearts suit :D

# Installation
This texture pack requires <a href="https://github.com/Kekulism/DeckSkinsLite"> DeckSkinsLite</a> to implement the textures properly. Once you have DeckSkinsLite set up, extract the zip file and copy the contents to the mod folder (...\AppData\Roaming\Balatro\Mods\DeckSkinsLite). From there, you should be all good to go!
